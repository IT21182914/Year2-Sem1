//(i) For N=5, How many processes are created when the program is executed?
//answer -> 2^5 , in this one we have to get all
//(ii)Modify the program so that only the parent process creates 3 child processes, and each
//new created process calls a function CPU(). In addition, make the parent process wait for each childâ€™s termination.
//answer -> above code is the answer
